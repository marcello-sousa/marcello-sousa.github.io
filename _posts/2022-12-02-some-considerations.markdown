### Analyzes show how Portinari produced his works
In partnership with restorers and museologists, the team led by nuclear physicist Márcia 
Rizzutto, from USP, used different physical-chemical analysis techniques to study works by Cândido Portinari. The findings may be useful to confirm the authorship of a painting found in his former home, Museu Casa de Portinari.

### Science and art are allied in the restoration of the painting "Independence or Death"

With support from FAPESP, researchers from USP's Institute of Physics and Institute of Chemistry provide the team of restorers with precise information on the chemical elements present in the pigments that give color to the painting, which is considered an official portrait of Brazilian nationality.
