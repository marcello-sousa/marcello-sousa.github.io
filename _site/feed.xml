<p> Analysis techniques through imaging are important ways of documenting, registering and studying heritage as a reliable source of information. Resulting in a set of characteristic and exclusive data, becoming an important document of the work itself. </p>

<h4 id="-visible-light-"><strong> Visible Light: </strong></h4>
<p>Allows you to register the work, the chromatic palette and stylistic details. The system used consists of a high resolution digital camera and several objective lenses and light sources with halogen lamps.</p>

<h4 id="x-ray-radiography-"><strong>X-ray radiography: </strong></h4>

<p> X-ray radiography is also a non-destructive technique, in which the image is obtained due to the attenuation of the X-rays by the material. For the production of the radiographic image, an X-ray source and a digital sensor are needed. The radiographic image can discriminate between denser and less dense materials. </p>

<h4 id="-visible-fluorescence-photography-with-ultraviolet-radiation-uv-"><strong> Visible Fluorescence Photography with Ultraviolet Radiation (UV): </strong></h4>

<p> Photographic technique in which fluorescence is recorded, in the range of visible light, generated by UV radiation, when this light falls on an object. The emission of fluorescence from a certain substance is due to the interaction of UV radiation with the existing materials in the work, and in this way it is possible to obtain superficial information from the pictorial layer, detecting anomalies in the polychrome, retouched areas, where it is difficult to distinguish between these and the original painting, and possible materials used by the artist. The visualization of retouching areas, restorations and recent interventions is visible by the different fluorescences, which appear in different bluish tones. If the varnishes covering the work are very old and thick, there will be a greenish fluorescence, which is produced when UV rays focus on them. </p>

<h4 id="-infrared-reflectography-irr-"><strong> Infrared Reflectography (IRR): </strong></h4>

<p> Infrared reflectography recording is a non-destructive technique, in which the image is obtained by recording in the near-infrared frequency range. For this, a camera dedicated to infrared reflectography called Osiris, from Opus Instruments, is used, which operates in the infrared range of 900 - 1700 nm. At the time of registration, halogen lamps are used, which focus visible and infrared light on the object. The observed image results from the conjunction of the phenomena of reflection, absorption and transmission of infrared light in the surface layer, which can often reveal hidden peculiarities such as pentimentos (regrets), pencil and graphite sketches, painting techniques, hidden registers, covered paintings, among others. </p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>
<p>X-radiography (X-ray imaging) is a widely used imaging technique in art investigation. It can provide information about the condition of a painting as well as insights into an artist’s techniques and working methods, often revealing hidden information invisible to the naked eye. In this paper, we deal with the problem of separating mixed X-ray images originating from the radiography of double-sided paintings. Using the visible color images (RGB images) from each side of the painting, we propose a new Neural Network architecture, based upon ‘connected’ auto-encoders, designed to separate the mixed X-ray image into two simulated X-ray images corresponding to each side. In this proposed architecture, the convolutional auto encoders extract features from the RGB images. These features are then used to (1) reproduce both of the original RGB images, (2) reconstruct the hypothetical separated X-ray images, and (3) regenerate the mixed X-ray image. The algorithm operates in a totally self-supervised fashion without requiring a sample set that contains both the mixed X-ray images and the separated ones. The methodology was tested on images from the double-sided wing panels of the Ghent Altarpiece, painted in 1432 by the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck. These tests show that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art X-ray image separation methods for art investigation applications.</p>
